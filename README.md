# Tracks
Website development for *Tracks*

*Tracks* was a piece by Vena Amoris Projects in Edmonton, Alberta from May 19th to May 24th, 2020. This piece was originally an in-person immersive theatrical experience, but due to COVID-19, was quickly reworked for an intimate, online performance. This piece required 9 performers streaming from 9 unique locations to reach audience sizes of up to 50 users.

The platform built for *Tracks* relied on websockets to maintain a constant connection with audiences and stage managers, who would active triggers on a back-end-ish control page. Audience members were able to engage with questions and chat rooms that the performers would further engage with in real time.

Streams were hosted on a media server on DigitalOcean, and the site itself could be found on Heroku.
